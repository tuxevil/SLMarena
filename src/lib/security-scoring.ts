/**
 * security-scoring.ts
 *
 * Shared, pure scenario-level scoring primitives used by both the internal
 * leaderboard (`aggregateLeaderboard`) and the public snapshot exporter
 * (`scripts/export-public-snapshot.ts`).
 *
 * Problem it solves (see GitHub issue #7): scenarios with 0% pass on every
 * model (e.g. Purple Team escape/firewall/MCP) do not discriminate but still
 * inflate every model's ASR when security is counted as a raw sample ratio.
 *
 * Solution:
 *  1. Per-scenario normalization: a model's dimension score is the weighted
 *     mean of its per-scenario scores, never a raw sample ratio.
 *  2. Discrimination weights: each scenario is weighted by the variance of
 *     the per-model failure rates across the model population. Scenarios
 *     where every model fails (or every model passes) get weight 0.
 *  3. Coverage floor: a model must cover at least MIN_SCENARIO_COVERAGE of
 *     the discriminating signal of every dimension where it has data to be
 *     eligible for ranking.
 *
 * Difficulty tiers are derived from the same data (never hand-tagged), so
 * they cannot drift out of sync with the measured difficulty.
